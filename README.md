### Deploying contract
  Deploying the contract using hardHat is simple. first we have the hardHat configuration file which has some simple logic to print the accounts and contains the configuration for the solidity version and the network we are using. In our case polygon.
  We use a dotenv file which is included in the git ignore. This file contains 2 important variables that are used to connect the applicaiton to the blockchain. The first is the api url which we use to access aclchemys node communication service. The second is the private key which holds the funds that we use to pay the gas fees for deploying.
